# Perfectly Ground Work Orders

# Architecture

## Backend

* DB schema defines a Coffee table, providing us with coffee names;
  And an Order table, with the required properties, and backend constraints to ensure we
  always get the most correct inputs, and provide us with appropriate errors when not.

* An OrderController acts as a surrogate to provide us with a view, a root url, and a way
  to pass in all the coffee data to the react app.

* A simple API at `/api/orders` gives the React app access to CRUD actions on work orders.
  The API is paginated via the Kaminari gem; and sanitized using ActiveModelSerializers.

* API tests written in RSpec.

## Frontend

* The app runs as a Single Page App, with a smart component maintaining all of the application
  state (`app/javascript/pages/work_orders`). This component coordinates page loading, data
  loading/saving, via callbacks from the other components.

* The order modal leverages ReactDayPicker for date picking.

* The order modal will default to creating a new, blank, order; unless it's passed an existing
  order as a prop, where it'll replace the default stateful one with a copy of the prop version.

* Updated orders will optimistically update the data store on save, and fully replaced once
  the AJAX call to the API completes.

* Extenstive use of CSS Modules throughout, which only needed a minor configuration change to
  enable in `config/webpack/environment.js`. These allow us to have CSS classes included directly
  to where they're being used, without having to write styles in JS; or include a large stylesheet
  where component styles may get orphaned over time; or fear naming collisions and weird
  cascading side effects.

  Standard CSS classes from the global `application.css` can still be used as necessary for
  generic styles (i.e., `.btn`, the grid, etc).

* A few Jest/Enzyme tests for example purposes. While not super familiar with using Jest/Enzyme,
  I did manage to get it setup and working for a couple components in the app. Given more time,
  I'd add more test coverage.

# Trade offs

* I went back and forth about having the SPA/API structure, or a more classic Rails view
  structure with React sprinkled in. Normally I'd err on the side of the classic approach,
  as it tends to enable faster, iterative, development with direct calls to the DB, and
  allows for future refactoring into richer React pages later on once the app is understood.

  In this case, as the project is a demonstation of using Rails and React, I felt taking the
  API driven route was OK, certainly as the list page desired tighter integration with React
  to view orders in more detail.

  For a bigger app I'd introduce React-Router, and Redux as needed. It would be better if
  pagination actually updated the URL, and React-Router would make that a pretty simple task.

* The brew method is stored as an enum in the model, which gives us a nice way to access
  the information. This could have been stored as a reference to another table, but at
  this stage in iteration that would probably be overkill. Since the values are stored
  as integers in the table, migrating to a foreign key relationship later wouldn't be too
  much work.

* For the interests of time, the core `WorkOrders` React component will request fresh API data
  every time the user clicks on the pagination buttons. The code is angled toward caching that
  data, and it would be a concern in a production environment. But for the sake of making order
  changes, and creating new orders quickly, the data gets reloaded.

* The modal sadly has no error handling. The API response will be a 400, with error strings,
  but the app will attempt to carry on regardless.

* Order creations occur silently, I considered spending some time adding a notice on completion,
  but didn't get to it.

# Running the code

Requires Ruby 2.5.1 to be installed, along with a recent version of Postgresql and Node.js.

```
$ bundle
$ yarn
$ rails db:setup # Will create the dev and test dbs, load the schema,
                   and initialize with some test seed data

$ rails s
```

After it boots up Puma, navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Testing

Run RSpec tests:
  ``$ rspec``

Run Jest/Enzyme tests:
  ``$ npm test``


# Deployment

* Can be pushed directly to Heroku for basic testing (demo: http://floating-depths-93049.herokuapp.com/)
* With the addition of a Capfile it could be easily made to be deployed via Capistrano
* Additional work can be done to deploy to Docker if we added a suitable Dockerfile and potentially docker-compose.yml depending on hosting strategy. Kubenetes, etc is a bit out of scope for this example.
